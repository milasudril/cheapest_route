# cheapest_route

A Dijkstra-based route-planner between two points on a grid.

This repo contains a utility application that can generate the cheapest route between two points in
a grayscale EXR image, that is treated as an heightmap. Below is an example of a generated path on
top of a false-color representation of the input data.
